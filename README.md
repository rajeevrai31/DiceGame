# DiceGame
This is a simple web-based dice game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game interface consists of a virtual dice and a "Roll Dice" button. When the button is clicked, the JavaScript function rollDice() is triggered. This function generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of a physical die.

The HTML structure sets up the layout, with a div element representing the dice and a button for rolling. The CSS file styles the elements to give them a dice-like appearance. The JavaScript function utilizes Math.random() to generate a random number, which is then displayed on the dice face.

The game is user-friendly, designed with a clean and intuitive interface. It can be easily customized by adjusting the CSS styles to change the look of the dice or button. While this example provides a basic implementation, there is potential for further expansion by adding features like animations, sounds, or a scoring system to enhance the gameplay experience.
